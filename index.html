      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-800 mb-4">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">I’m based in Toronto, where I’ve built a career blending engineering with cutting-edge technoloyg. From designing mechanical parts to securing global companies at scale, I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities. Currently, I’m at TD Bank, advising technology teams on data security, but my journey has also taken me through cloud engineering at PwC, cybersecurity strategy, and even big mechanical product launches.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Outside of work, you’ll find me tinkering with network infrastructure and code, running and excercising, reading, and doing renovations at home. I’m all about balance—tech keeps me sharp, but life’s too short not to enjoy it and learn other skills too!</p>
